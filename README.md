Alpha 0.81d
===========
10-24-2016
----------

Whole new camera system! Native support for XBox 360 and Dualshock4 controllers with autodetect!

* Issue 54: – The sensibility of the mouse is very low, even at “High”. I think that the “Low” sens should be the “High” one. “Normal” should be x2 the “High” one, “High” should be x3/x4 the “High” one.
* Issue 55: – The screen vibrates a lot when you walk, after some time you get used to it, but you are aware of it when you look to the horizon.
* Issue 56: – You can run faster if you try to go “diagonal” (ie: up and right at the same time). It”s like the speed of both directions is added.
* Issue 61: Larger collision boxes for flowers and notes
* Issue 63: “melting” state for water hexas
* Issue 64: “spinning down” state for bouncer hexas
* Issue 65: adjust water freeze times. too easy right now
* Issue 66: Had burst charging (I was holding down the mouse button) when I entered the cut scene for picking up the float power up. The charge sound effect kept looping.
* Issue 67: update laval hexa collision mesh
* Issue 71: improved camera controls
* Issue 73: wider collision mesh for Newt
* Issue 74: any key should advance dialog (not just jump/burst)
* Issue 76: native XBox 360 controller support
* Issue 77: native Dual Shock 4 controller support
* Issue 78: auto-detect controllers (XBox360/Dualshock4), use mouse/keys if none found
* Issue 47: “any key” should move forward in cutscenes and/or end them. Jumping at end of cutscene is weird.

Alpha 0.8
=========
10-11-2016
----------

3 new difficulty levels. When you fall now in Easy or normal, you’ll respawn where you were just before the fall. No longer will you have to start at the very beginning of the level – unless you are playing on “Hard”. in “Easy” more you’ll start each level with Float and Burst. In “Normal” you’ll start without the powers, but will keep them once found.

NThanks to everyone for checking out the super early alpha. we got some great feedback and have incorporated what we could this week. Please take a moment to fill out your system specs in the “My Account/Submit Issue” screen and use this screen to submit issues. Big shout out to user Rodein who turned in very specific notes on found issues.

* Issue 57: Maybe it”s not a bug but, when a water tile is frozen you cannot “reset” the time if you try to freeze it again. Ie: if the time of a frozen tile is 5 seconds and 2 seconds have passed, you cannot reset the time to 5; so you have to wait in order to the tile becoming water again.
* Issue 60: New difficulty modes: Easy – start with powers and respawn where u were. Normal- start with no powers and respawn were you were retaining powers. Expert – start with no powers and respawn at start without powers.
* Issue 61: Larger collision boxes for flowers and notes
* Issue 62: update reset path
* Issue 65: adjust water freeze times. too easy right now
